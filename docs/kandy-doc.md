   has been initiated.

The [call.getById][12] API can be used to retrieve the
   current information about the call.

The SDK will emit a [call:start][16] event
   locally when the operation completes. When the remote participant
   receives the call, a [call:receive][17]
   event will be emitted remotely for them.

The SDK requires access to the machine's media devices (e.g. microphone)
   in order to make a call. If it does not already have permissions to
   use the devices, the user may be prompted by the browser to give
   permissions.

**Parameters**

-   `destination` **(UserID | PhoneNumber)** The desired destination.
-   `media` **[Object][3]** The media options the call should be initialized with.
    -   `media.audio` **[boolean][6]** Whether the call should have audio on start. Currently, audio-less calls are not supported. (optional, default `false`)

```javascript
// Listen for the event emitted after making a call.
client.on('call:start', function (params) {
  const { callId, error } = params
  if (error) {
    // Call failed to initialize.
  } else {
    // Call was initialized, and the recipient user will be notified.
  }
})
// Make an audio-only call.
const newCallId = client.call.make(destination, { audio: true })
```

   [call.getById][12] API can be used to retrieve the
   latest call state after the change. Further events will be emitted to
   indicate that the call has received media from the remote participant.
   See the [call:newTrack][19] event for
   more information about this.

The SDK requires access to the system's media devices (eg. microphone)
   in order to answer a call. If it does not already have permissions to

   call taken off hold, and will receive additional audio from other
   participants after the operation. Both calls for the current user will
   be ended after the operation.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][4]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `otherCallId` **[string][4]** ID of the other call being acted on.

### replaceTrack

Replace a call's track with a new track of the same media type.

The operation will remove the old track from the call and add a
   new track to the call. This effectively allows for changing the
   track constraints (eg. device used) for an ongoing call.

The SDK will emit a
   [call:trackReplaced][23] event
   locally when the operation completes. The newly added track will need
   to be handled by the local application. The track will be replaced
   seamlessly for the remote application, which will not receive an event.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][4]** The ID of the call to replace the track of.
-   `trackId` **[string][4]** The ID of the track to replace.
-   `media` **[Object][3]** The media options. (optional, default `{}`)
    -   `media.audio` **[boolean][6]** Whether to create an audio track. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.audioOptions` **[Object][3]?** Options for configuring the audio track.
        -   `media.audioOptions.deviceId` **MediaConstraint?** ID of the microphone to receive audio from.
    -   `media.video` **[boolean][6]** Whether to create a video track. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.videoOptions` **[Object][3]?** Options for configuring the video track.
        -   `media.videoOptions.deviceId` **MediaConstraint?** ID of the camera to receive video from.
        -   `media.videoOptions.height` **MediaConstraint?** The height of the video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.width` **MediaConstraint?** The width of the video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.frameRate` **MediaConstraint?** The frame rate of the video.

**Examples**

```javascript
const callId = ...
// Get the video track used by the call.
const videoTrack = ...

// Replace the specified video track of the call with a new
//    video track.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack.id, {
  // The track should be replaced with a video track using
  //    a specific device. This effectively changes the input
  //    device for an ongoing call.
  video: true,
  videoOptions: {
    deviceId: cameraId
  }
})
```

### states

Possible states that a Call can be in.

A Call's state describes the current status of the Call. An application
   should use the state to understand how the Call, and any media
   associated with the Call, should be handled. Which state the Call is
   in defines how it can be interacted with, as certain operations can
   only be performed while in specific states, and tells an application
   whether the Call currently has media flowing between users.

The Call's state is a property of the [CallObject][24], which can be
   retrieved using the [call.getById][12] or
   [call.getAll][11] APIs.

The SDK emits a [call:stateChange][18]
   event when a Call's state changes from one state to another.

**Properties**

-   `INITIATING` **[string][4]** The (outgoing) call is being started.
-   `INITIATED` **[string][4]** The (outgoing) call has been sent over the network, but has not been received.
-   `RINGING` **[string][4]** The call has been received by both parties, and is waiting to be answered.
-   `CANCELLED` **[string][4]** The call was disconnected before it could be answered.
-   `CONNECTED` **[string][4]** Both parties are connected and media is flowing.
-   `ON_HOLD` **[string][4]** Both parties are connected but no media is flowing.
-   `ENDED` **[string][4]** The call has ended.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Use the call states to know how to handle a change in the call.
client.on('call:stateChange', function (params) {
   const call = client.call.getById(params.callId)
   // Check if the call now has media flowing.
   if (call.state === client.call.states.CONNECTED) {
     // Render call media ...
   }
})

## Media

The Media feature provides an interface for interacting with Media that the
   SDK has access to. Media is used conjunction with the [Calls][39]
   feature to manipulate and render the Tracks sent and received from a Call.

Media and Track objects are not created directly, but are created as part of
   Call operations. Media and Tracks will either be marked as "local" or
   "remote" depending on whether their source is the local user's machine
   or a remote user's machine.

The Media feature also keeps track of media devices that the user's machine
   can access. Any media device (eg. USB headset) connected to the machine
   can be used as a source for media. Available devices can be found using
   the [media.getDevices][40] API.

Media functions are all part of the 'media' namespace.

### getDevices

    This property applies only to message objects stored in sender's state.
-   `deliveryStatus` **[string][4]** Tracks the status of the outgoing message ('Pending', 'Delivered', 'Failed', 'Unknown', etc).
    This property applies only to the message object stored in sender's state.

## Presence

The Presence feature provides an interface for an application to set the
   User's presence information and to track other Users' presence
   information.

Presence information is persisted by the server. When the SDK is initialized,
   there will be no information available. Presence information will become
   available either by using [presence.fetch][58] or
   by subscribing for updates about other Users, using
   [presence.subscribe][59].

Available presence information can be retrieved using
   [presence.get][60] or [presence.getAll][61].

Presence APIs are part of the 'presence' namespace.

### statuses

Possible presence status values.

**Properties**

-   `OPEN` **[string][4]** 
-   `CLOSED` **[string][4]** 

**Examples**

```javascript
const { statuses, activities } = client.presence
// Use the values when updating presence.
client.presence.update(statuses.OPEN, activities.AVAILABLE)
```

### activities

Possible presence activity values.

**Properties**

-   `AVAILABLE` **[string][4]** 
-   `BUSY` **[string][4]** 
-   `LUNCH` **[string][4]**

-   `ACTIVITIES_UNKNOWN` **[string][4]** 
-   `ACTIVITIES_OTHER` **[string][4]** 

**Examples**

```javascript
const { statuses, activities } = client.presence
// Use the values when updating presence.
client.presence.update(statuses.OPEN, activities.AVAILABLE)
```

### update

Updates the presence information for the current user.

See [presence.statuses][62] and
   [presence.activities][63] for valid values.

The SDK will emit a
   [presence:selfChange][64] event
   when the operation completes. The updated presence information is
   available and can be retrieved with
   [presence.getSelf][65].

Other users subscribed for this user's presence will receive a
   [presence:change][66] event.

**Parameters**

-   `status` **[string][4]** The status of the presence state.
-   `activity` **[string][4]** The activity to be shown as presence state
-   `note` **[string][4]?** An additional note to be provided when the activity is `presence.activities.ACTIVITIES_OTHER`.

### get

**Parameters**

-   `user` **([Array][8]&lt;[string][4]> | [string][4])** A User ID or an array of User IDs.

Returns **([Array][8]&lt;[Object][3]> | [Object][3])** List of user presence information.

### getAll

Retrieves the presence information for all available users.

Returns **[Array][8]&lt;[Object][3]>** List of user presence information.

### getSelf

Retrieves the presence information for the current user.

This information is set using the [presnece.update][67]
   API.

Returns **[Object][3]** Presence information for the current user.

### fetch

Fetches presence information for the given users. This will refresh the
   available information with any new information from the server.

Available presence information an be retrieved using the
   [presence.get][60] or
   [presence.getAll][61] APIs.

**Parameters**

-   `user` **([Array][8]&lt;[string][4]> | [string][4])** A User ID or an array of User IDs.

### subscribe

Subscribe to another User's presence updates.

When the User updates their presence information, the SDK will emit a
   [presence:change][66] event.

**Parameters**

-   `users` **([Array][8]&lt;[string][4]> | [string][4])** A User ID or an array of User IDs.

### unsubscribe

Unsubscribe from another User's presence updates.

**Parameters**

-   `users` **([Array][8]&lt;[string][4]> | [string][4])** A User ID or an array of User IDs.

## sdpHandlers

A set of [SdpHandlerFunction][68]s for manipulating SDP information.
These handlers are used to customize low-level call behaviour for very specific
environments and/or scenarios. They can be provided during SDK instantiation
to be used for all calls.

**Examples**

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';
const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover(['VP8', 'VP9'])
const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [ <Your-SDP-Handler-Function>, ...]
  }
})
```

### createCodecRemover

In some scenarios it's necessary to remove certain codecs being offered by the SDK to the remote party.
While creating an SDP handler would allow a user to perform this type of manipulation, it is a non-trivial task that requires in-depth knowledge of WebRTC SDP.

To facilitate this common task, the SDK provides a codec removal handler creator that can be used for this purpose.

The SDP handlers are exposed on the entry point of the SDK. They need to be added to the list of SDP handlers via configuration on creation of an instance of the SDK.

**Parameters**

-   `codecs` **[Array][8]&lt;[string][4]>** A list of codec names to remove from the SDP.

**Examples**

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';
const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover(['VP8', 'VP9'])
const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [codecRemover]
  }
})
```

Returns **SdpHandlerFunction** The resulting SDP handler that will remove the codec.

## Subscription

The Services feature allows an application to manage how they wish the SDK to
   receive communications from the platform. An application can subscribe to
   services in order to receive updates about that service for the current
   user. A feature generally requires a subscription for its service to be
   fully functional.

The services an application can subscribe to are based on the features
   included in the SDK. The list of available services can be retrieved
   using the [services.getSubscriptions][69]
   API. These values can be used with the
   [services.subscribe][70] API.

The channel used for subscriptions is the method for receiving the service
   updates. The recommended channel is `websocket`, where the SDK is able to
   handle receiving the updates internally. Alternate channel methods, if a
   websocket cannot be used, will be available in the future.

Service functions are all part of the 'services' namespace.

### subscribe

Subscribes to platform notifications for an SDK service.

Subscriptions can only be made for services available to the SDK. See
   [services.getSubscriptions][69] for
   information about services.

The SDK currently only supports the `websocket` channel as a subscription
   type.

**Parameters**

-   `services` **[Array][8]&lt;[string][4]>** A list of available services.
-   `type` **[string][4]** The method of how to receive service updates. (optional, default `'websocket'`)

### unsubscribe

Cancels existing subscriptions for platform notifications.

Existing subscriptions can be retrieved using the
   [services.getSubscriptions][71] API.
   The `subscribed` values are the services that can be unsubscribed from.

**Parameters**

-   `services` **[Array][8]&lt;[string][4]>** A list of subscribed services.
-   `type` **[string][4]** The method of how the service updates
       are being received. (optional, default `'websocket'`)

### getSubscriptions

Retrieves information about currently subscribed services and available services.

The `available` values are the SDK's services that an application can
   subscribe to receive notifications about. A feature generally
   requires a subscription to its service in order to be fully functional.

The `subscribed` values are the SDK's services that the application has
   an active subscription for. Services are subscribed to using the
   [services.subscribe][72] API.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Get the lists of services.
const services = client.services.getSubscriptions()

// Figure out which available services don't have a subscription.
const notSubscribed = services.available.filter(service => {
   return !services.subscribed.includes(service)
})

// Subscribe for all not-yet-subscribed services.
client.services.subscribe(notSubscribed)
```

Returns **[Object][3]** Lists of subscribed and available services.

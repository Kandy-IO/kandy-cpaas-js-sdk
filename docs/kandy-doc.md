client.on('call:start', function (params) {
  const { callId, error } = params
  if (error) {
    // Call failed to initialize.
  } else {
    // Call was initialized, and the recipient user will be notified.
  }
})
// Make an audio-only call.
const newCallId = client.call.make(destination, { audio: true })
```

   direction. The call will be ended as a result of the operation.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][28] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][34]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified, through their own
   [call:stateChange][34] event, that the
   call was rejected.

**Parameters**

   [call:operation][28] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][34]
   event locally when the operation completes. This indicates that the
   call has connected with the remote participant. The
   [call.getById][22] API can be used to retrieve the latest call state
   after the change. Further events will be emitted to indicate that the
   call has received media from the remote participant. See the
   [call:newTrack][35] event for more
   information about this.

   the call was held.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][28] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][34]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified of the operation through a
   [call:stateChange][34] event as well.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call to unhold.

### getAll

Retrieves the information of all calls made during the current session.

**Examples**

```javascript
let calls = client.call.getAll()
let currentCalls = calls.filter(call => {
    return call.state === client.call.states.CONNECTED
})
```

Returns **[Array][12]&lt;[call.CallObject][37]>** Call objects.

### getById

Retrieves the information of a single call with a specific call ID.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call to retrieve.

Returns **[call.CallObject][37]** A call object.

### end

The SDK will stop any/all local media associated with the call. Events
   will be emitted to indicate which media tracks were stopped. See the
   [call:trackEnded][38] event for more
   information.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][28] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][34]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified, through their own
   [call:stateChange][34] event, that the
   call was ended.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call to end.

### addMedia

Will get new media tracks from the specific sources to add to the call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][28] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:newTrack][35] event
   both for the local and remote users to indicate a track has been
   added to the Call.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call to add media to.

### startVideo

Adds local video to an ongoing Call, to start sending to the remote
   participant.

Can only be used in a basic media scenario, where the Call does not
   already have video. For more advanced scenarios, the
   [call.addMedia][39] API can be used.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][28] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:newTrack][35] event
   both for the local and remote users to indicate a track has been
   added to the Call.

### stopVideo

Removes local video from an ongoing Call, stopping it from being sent
   to the remote participant.

Can only be used in a basic media scenario, where the Call has only one
   video track. For more advanced scenarios, the
   [call.removeMedia][40] API can be used.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][28] event.

The SDK will emit a [call:trackEnded][38]
   event for both the local and remote users to indicate that a track
   has been removed.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** ID of the call being acted on.

### startScreenshare

Adds local screenshare to an ongoing Call, to start sending to the remote
   participant.

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
   same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
   of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
   same behaviour.

The [call.addMedia][39] API can be used to perform the same behaviour
   as `startScreenshare`. [call.addMedia][39] is a general-purpose API
   for adding media to a call, which covers the same functionality as
   `startScreenshare`. Selecting only screen options when using
   [call.addMedia][39] will perform the same behaviour as using
   `startScreenshare`.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Select media options for adding only screenshare.
const media = {
   audio: false,
   video: false,
   screen: true,
   screenOptions: { ... }
}

// Add the selected media to the call.
client.call.addMedia(callId, media)
```

### sendDTMF

Send DTMF tones to a call's audio.

The provided tone can either be a single DTMF tone (eg. '1') or a
   sequence of DTMF tones (eg. '123') which will be played one after the
   other.

The specified call must be either in Connected, Ringing, or Early Media
   state, otherwise invoking this API will have no effect.

The tones will be sent as out-of-band tones if supported by the call,
   otherwise they will be added in-band to the call's audio.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][28] event.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `tone` **[string][7]** DTMF tone(s) to send. Valid chracters are ['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','#','*' and ','].
-   `duration` **[number][11]** The amount of time, in milliseconds, that each DTMF tone should last. (optional, default `100`)
-   `intertoneGap` **[number][11]** The length of time, in milliseconds, to wait between tones. (optional, default `70`)

### stopScreenshare

Removes local screenshare from an ongoing Call, stopping it from being
   sent to the remote participant.

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
   same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
   of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
   same behaviour.

The [call.removeMedia][40] API can be used to perform the same
   behaviour as `stopScreenshare`. [call.removeMedia][40] is a
   general-purpose API for removing media from a call, which covers the
   same functionality as `stopScreenshare`. Specifying only the screen
   track when using [call.removeMedia][40] will perform the same
   behaviour as using `stopScreenshare`.

There is a caveat that if a Call has multiple video tracks (for example,
   both a video and a screen track), the SDK itself cannot yet
   differentiate one from the other. The application will need to know
   which track was the screen track in this scenario.

**Examples**

```javascript
const call = client.call.getById(callId)
// Get the ID of any/all video tracks on the call.
const videoTracks = call.localTracks.filter(trackId => {
   const track = call.media.getTrackById(trackId)
   // Both video and screen tracks have kind of 'video'.
   return track.kind === 'video'
})

// Pick out the screen track.
const screenTrack = videoTracks[0]

// Remove screen from the call.
client.call.removeMedia(callId, [ screenTrack ])
```

### getStats

Get a report about low-level call statistical information.

A Track ID can optionally be provided to get a report for a specific
   Track of the Call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][28] event.

The SDK will emit a
   [call:statsReceived][41] event, after
   the operation completes, that has the report.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the Call to retrieve the report.
-   `trackId` **[string][7]?** ID of a Track being used by the Call. If not
       provided, RTCStatsReport is generated for the Call itself.

### replaceTrack

Replace a call's track with a new track of the same media type.

The operation will remove the old track from the call and add a
   new track to the call. This effectively allows for changing the
   track constraints (eg. device used) for an ongoing call.

The progress of the operation will be tracked via the
   [call:operation][28] event.

The SDK will emit a
   [call:trackReplaced][42] event
   locally when the operation completes. The newly added track will need
   to be handled by the local application. The track will be replaced
   seamlessly for the remote application, which will not receive an event.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][7]** The ID of the call to replace the track of.
-   `trackId` **[string][7]** The ID of the track to replace.
-   `media` **[Object][6]** The media options. (optional, default `{}`)
    -   `media.audio` **[boolean][10]** Whether to create an audio track. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.audioOptions` **[Object][6]?** Options for configuring the audio track.
        -   `media.audioOptions.deviceId` **[call.MediaConstraint][33]?** ID of the microphone to receive audio from.
    -   `media.video` **[boolean][10]** Whether to create a video track. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.videoOptions` **[Object][6]?** Options for configuring the video track.
        -   `media.videoOptions.deviceId` **[call.MediaConstraint][33]?** ID of the camera to receive video from.
        -   `media.videoOptions.height` **[call.MediaConstraint][33]?** The height of the video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.width` **[call.MediaConstraint][33]?** The width of the video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.frameRate` **[call.MediaConstraint][33]?** The frame rate of the video.

**Examples**

```javascript
const callId = ...
// Get the video track used by the call.
const videoTrack = ...

// Replace the specified video track of the call with a new
//    video track.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack.id, {
  // The track should be replaced with a video track using
  //    a specific device. This effectively changes the input
  //    device for an ongoing call.
  video: true,
  videoOptions: {
    deviceId: cameraId
  }
})
```

### changeSpeaker

Changes the speaker used for a Call's audio output. Supported on
   browser's that support HTMLMediaElement.setSinkId().

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
   same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
   of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
   same behaviour.

The same behaviour as the `changeSpeaker` API can be implemented by
   re-rendering the Call's audio track.  A speaker can be selected when
   rendering an audio track, so changing a speaker can be simulated
   by unrendering the track with [media.removeTracks][43], then
   re-rendering it with a new speaker with [media.renderTracks][44].

**Examples**

```javascript
const call = client.call.getById(callId)
// Get the ID of the Call's audio track.
const audioTrack = call.localTracks.find(trackId => {
   const track = client.media.getTrackById(trackId)
   return track.kind === 'audio'
})

// Where the audio track was previously rendered.
const audioContainer = ...

// Unrender the audio track we want to change speaker for.
client.media.removeTrack([ audioTrack ], audioContainer)
// Re-render the audio track with a new speaker.
client.media.renderTrack([ audioTrack ], audioContainer, {
   speakerId: 'speakerId'
})
```

### states

Possible states that a Call can be in.

A Call's state describes the current status of the Call. An application
   should use the state to understand how the Call, and any media
   associated with the Call, should be handled. Which state the Call is
   in defines how it can be interacted with, as certain operations can
   only be performed while in specific states, and tells an application
   whether the Call currently has media flowing between users.

The Call's state is a property of the [CallObject][45],
   which can be retrieved using the [call.getById][22] or
   [call.getAll][21] APIs.

The SDK emits a [call:stateChange][34]
   event when a Call's state changes from one state to another.

**Properties**

-   `INITIATING` **[string][7]** The (outgoing) call is being started.
-   `INITIATED` **[string][7]** The (outgoing) call has been sent over the network, but has not been received.
-   `RINGING` **[string][7]** The call has been received by both parties, and is waiting to be answered.
-   `EARLY_MEDIA` **[string][7]** The call has not been answered, but media
       is already being received. This may be network-ringing media, IVR
       system media, or other pre-answer medias. When early media is
       supported, this state may replace the Ringing state.
-   `CANCELLED` **[string][7]** The call was disconnected before it could be answered.
-   `CONNECTED` **[string][7]** Both parties are connected and media is flowing.
-   `ON_HOLD` **[string][7]** Both parties are connected but no media is flowing.
-   `ENDED` **[string][7]** The call has ended.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Use the call states to know how to handle a change in the call.
client.on('call:stateChange', function (params) {
   const call = client.call.getById(params.callId)
   // Check if the call now has media flowing.
   if (call.state === client.call.states.CONNECTED) {
     // The call is now active, and can perform midcall operations.
   }
})
```

### setDefaultDevices

The `setDefaultDevices` API from previous SDK releases (3.X) has been
   deprecated in the latest releases (4.X+). The SDK no longer keeps
   track of "default devices" on behalf of the application.

The devices used for a call can be selected as part of the APIs for
   starting the call. Microphone and/or camera can be chosen in the
   [call.make][46] and [call.answer][47] APIs, and speaker can be
   chosen when the audio track is rendered with the
   [media.renderTracks][44] API.

### changeInputDevices

Changes the camera and/or microphone used for a Call's media input.

The latest SDK release (v4.X+) has not yet implemented this API in the
   same way that it was available in previous releases (v3.X). In place
   of this API, the SDK has a more general API that can be used for this
   same behaviour.

The same behaviour as the `changeInputDevices` API can be implemented
   using the general-purpose [call.replaceTrack][48] API. This API can
   be used to replace an existing media track with a new track of the
   same type, allowing an application to change certain aspects of the
   media, such as input device.

**Examples**

```javascript
const call = client.call.getById(callId)
// Get the ID of the Call's video track.
const videoTrack = call.localTracks.find(trackId => {
   const track = client.media.getTrackById(trackId)
   return track.kind === 'video'
})

// Select the new video options.
const media = {
   video: true,
   videoOptions: {
       deviceId: 'cameraId'
   }
}

// Change the call's camera by replacing the video track.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack, media)
```

### Message

A Message object is a means by which a sender can deliver information to a recipient.

Creating and sending a message:

The message object can be obtained through the [Conversation.createMessage][58] API on an existing conversation.

Messages have Parts which represent pieces of a message, such as a text part, a json object part or a file part.
Once all the desired parts have been added to the message using the [Message.addPart][65] function,
the message can then be sent using the [Message.send][59] function.

Once the sender sends a message, this message is saved in sender's state as an object.
Similarly, once the recipient gets a message, this message is saved in recipient's state.

Retrieving a delivered message:

Once a message is delivered successfully, it can be
obtained through the [Conversation.getMessages][63] or [Conversation.getMessage][66] API on an existing conversation.

Below are the properties pertaining to the message object, returned by Conversation.getMessage(s) APIs, for either sender or recipient.

Type: [Object][6]

**Properties**

-   `timestamp` **[number][11]** A Unix timestamp in seconds marking the time when the message was created by sender.
-   `parts` **[Array][12]&lt;[conversation.Part][62]>** An array of Part Objects.
-   `sender` **[string][7]** The primary contact address of the sender.
-   `destination` **[Array][12]&lt;[string][7]>** An array of primary contact addresses associated with various destinations to which the message is meant to be delivered.
-   `messageId` **[string][7]** The unique id of the message. The message object (stored in sender's state) has a different id
    than the one associated with the message object stored in recipient's state.
-   `type` **[string][7]** The type of message that was sent. See [conversation.chatTypes][53] for valid types.
    This property applies only to message objects stored in sender's state.
-   `isFetchingLinks` **[boolean][10]** Whether or not the recipient of the message is in the process of fetching the message attachment(s) using the provided link(s).

#### send

Sends the message.

#### addPart

Add an additional `Part` to a message.

**Parameters**

-   `part` **[conversation.Part][62]** The `Part` to add to the message.

-   `file` **File?** The file to attach to a message. A `Part` cannot have both json and a file.

## groups

The 'groups' namespace provides an interface for an application to create and
   manage Groups for a User. Groups are used in conjuction with the
   [Messaging][67] feature to allow for group conversations.

Groups are persisted by the server. When the SDK is initialized, there will
   be no Group information available, but the [groups.fetch][68]
   API is used to make available any Groups that were created
   previously.

The creator of a Group is the Group's administrator.

### create

Creates a Group.

The SDK will emit a [group:new][69] event locally
   when the operation completes. This event will include a Group ID that
   is used to uniquely identify the group.

Remote users added to the Group during creation will receive a
   `group:invitation_received` event, which will include information
   about the Group. Group participants can be managed after creation
   using the [groups.addParticipant][70] and
   [groups.removeParticipant][71] APIs.

Group information will become available after the operation completes
   using the [groups.get][72] and [groups.getAll][73] APIs.

**Parameters**

           invitation-based closed chat group. Only Closed supported.

### fetch

Fetches information about all Groups that the current user is a member
   of. This will refresh the available Groups with any new information
   from the server.

The SDK will emit a [group:refresh][74] event
   when the operation completes.

Information about an available Group can be retrieved using the
   [groups.getAll][73] or [groups.get][72] APIs.

   for all participants in the Group.

**Parameters**

-   `groupId` **[string][7]** The ID of the Group to delete.

## logger

The internal logger is used to provide information about the SDK's behaviour.
The logger can provide two types of logs: basic logs and action logs. Basic
logs are simple lines of information about what the SDK is doing during operations.
Action logs are complete information about a specific action that occurred
within the SDK, providing debug information describing it.
The amount of information logged can be configured as part of the SDK configuration.
See [config.logs][78] .

### levels

Possible levels for the SDK logger.

**Properties**

-   `SILENT` **[string][7]** Log nothing.
-   `ERROR` **[string][7]** Log only unhandled errors.
-   `WARN` **[string][7]** Log issues that may cause problems or unexpected behaviour.
-   `INFO` **[string][7]** Log useful information and messages to indicate the SDK's internal operations.
-   `DEBUG` **[string][7]** Log information to help diagnose problematic behaviour.

### LogEntry

A LogEntry object is the data that the SDK compiles when information is
   logged. It contains both the logged information and meta-info about when
   and who logged it.

A [LogHandler][4] provided to the SDK (see
   [config.logs][78]) will need to handle LogEntry
   objects.

Type: [Object][6]

**Properties**

-   `timestamp` **[number][11]** When the log was created, based on UNIX epoch.
-   `method` **[string][7]** The log function that was used to create the log.
-   `level` **[string][7]** The level of severity the log.
-   `target` **[Object][6]** The subject that the log is about.
    -   `target.type` **[string][7]** The type of the target. This is also
           used as part of the name of the Logger.
    -   `target.id` **[string][7]?** A unique identifer for the target.
    -   `target.name` **[string][7]** A combination of the target type and ID. If no
           id was provided, this will be the same as the type.
-   `messages` **[Array][12]** The logged information, given to the Logger
       method as parameters.

**Examples**

```javascript
function defaultLogHandler (logEntry) {
  // Compile the meta info of the log for a prefix.
  const { timestamp, level, method, target } = logEntry
  const logInfo = `${timestamp} - ${target.type} - ${level}`

  // Assume that the first message parameter is a string.
  const [log, ...extra] = logEntry.messages

  console[method](`${logInfo} - ${log}`, ...extra)
}
```

### LogHandler

A LogHandler can be used to customize how the SDK should log information. By
   default, the SDK will log information to the console, but a LogHandler can
   be configured to change this behaviour.

A LogHandler can be provided to the SDK as part of its configuration (see
   [config.logs][78]). The SDK will then provide this
   function with the logged information.

Type: [Function][14]

**Parameters**

-   `LogEntry` **[Object][6]** The LogEntry to be logged.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Define a custom function to handle logs.
function logHandler (logEntry) {
  // Compile the meta info of the log for a prefix.
  const { timestamp, level, method, target } = logEntry
  const logInfo = `${timestamp} - ${target.type} - ${level}`

  // Assume that the first message parameter is a string.
  const [log, ...extra] = logEntry.messages

  console[method](`${logInfo} - ${log}`, ...extra)
}

// Provide the LogHandler as part of the SDK configurations.
const configs = { ... }
configs.logs.handler = logHandler
const client = create(configs)
```

## media

The 'media' namespace provides an interface for interacting with Media that the
   SDK has access to. Media is used in conjunction with the [Calls][79]
   feature to manipulate and render the Tracks sent and received from a Call.

Media and Track objects are not created directly, but are created as part of
   Call operations. Media and Tracks will either be marked as "local" or
   "remote" depending on whether their source is the local user's machine
   or a remote user's machine.

The Media feature also keeps track of media devices that the user's machine
   can access. Any media device (eg. USB headset) connected to the machine
   can be used as a source for media. Available devices can be found using
   the [media.getDevices][80] API.

### getDevices

Retrieves the available media devices for use.

The [devices:change][81] event will be
   emitted when the available media devices have changed.

Returns **[Object][6]** The lists of camera, microphone, and speaker devices.

   corresponds to the HTMLElement to act as the container.

**Parameters**

-   `trackIds` **[Array][12]&lt;[string][7]>** List of Track IDs to be rendered.
-   `cssSelector` **[string][7]** A CSS selector string that uniquely
       identifies an element. Ensure that special characters are properly
       escaped.
-   `options` **[Object][6]?** Additional options for rendering the tracks.
    -   `options.speakerId` **[string][7]?** The speaker's Device ID to use for audio tracks.

**Examples**

```javascript
// When a Call receives a new track, render it.
client.on('call:newTrack', function (params) {
   const track = client.media.getTrackById(params.trackId)
   const container = params.local ? localContainer : remoteContainer

   // Render the Call's new track when it first becomes available.
   client.media.renderTracks([ track.id ], container)
})
```

### removeTracks

Remove Media Tracks from a container.

The container is specified by providing a CSS selector string that
   corresponds to the HTMLElement to act as the container.

**Parameters**

-   `trackIds` **[Array][12]&lt;[string][7]>** List of Track IDs to stop being rendered.
-   `cssSelector` **[string][7]** A CSS selector string that uniquely
       identifies an element. Ensure that special characters are properly
       escaped.

### muteTracks

Mutes the specified Tracks at their media source.

Prevents media from being received for the Tracks. Audio Tracks will
   become silent and video Tracks will be a black frame.

If a local Track being sent in a Call is muted, the Track will be
   noticeably muted for the remote user. If a remote Track received in a
   call is muted, the result will only be noticeable locally.

The SDK will emit a [media:muted][83] event
   when a Track has been muted.

**Parameters**

-   `trackIds` **[Array][12]&lt;[string][7]>** List of Track IDs.

### unmuteTracks

Unmutes the specified Tracks.

Media will resume as normal for the Tracks.

The SDK will emit a [media:unmuted][84] event
   when a Track has been unmuted.

**Parameters**

-   `trackIds` **[Array][12]&lt;[string][7]>** List of Track IDs.

## presence

The 'presence' namespace provides an interface for an application to set the
   User's presence information and to track other Users' presence
   information.

Presence information is persisted by the server. When the SDK is initialized,
   there will be no information available. Presence information will become
   available either by using [presence.fetch][85] or by subscribing for
   updates about other Users, using [presence.subscribe][86].

Available presence information can be retrieved using [presence.get][87] or
   [presence.getAll][88].

### statuses

Possible presence status values.

**Properties**

-   `OPEN` **[string][7]** 
-   `CLOSED` **[string][7]** 

**Examples**

```javascript
const { statuses, activities } = client.presence
// Use the values when updating presence.

client.presence.update(statuses.OPEN, activities.AVAILABLE)
```

### PresenceStatus

The PresenceStatus type defines the user's current status in terms of the user's availability to
communicate/respond to other users in the network.
An instance of this type can be obtained by invoking the [presence.get][87] function.

Reporting when a user is on the phone is enabled (by default), which means that presence update notifications
will be sent whenever a user is in a call, as well as when the call has ended.
This is a user preference enabled or disabled on server side, and it can only be changed on the server side.

The status is set to [open][89] as soon as a user subscribes for the presence service.

Type: [Object][6]

**Properties**

-   `userId` **[string][7]** The unique identifier for the user associated with this presence status.
-   `status` **[string][7]** The current status the user has set for themselves. For supported values see [presence.statuses][89].
-   `activity` **[string][7]** The current activity of the user.
         For supported values see [presence.activities][90].
-   `note` **[string][7]** Additional message acompanying the status & activity.
-   `loading` **[boolean][10]** Whether the presence information has been loaded or is in the process of loading.

### update

Updates the presence information for the current user.

See [presence.statuses][89] and [presence.activities][90] for valid
   values.

The SDK will emit a
   [presence:selfChange][91] event
   when the operation completes. The updated presence information is
   available and can be retrieved with [presence.getSelf][92].

Other users subscribed for this user's presence will receive a
   [presence:change][93] event.

**Parameters**

-   `status` **[string][7]** The status of the presence state.
-   `activity` **[string][7]** The activity to be shown as presence state
-   `note` **[string][7]?** An additional note to be provided when the activity is `presence.activities.ACTIVITIES_OTHER`.

### get

Retrieves the presence information for specified users, if available.

**Parameters**

-   `user` **([Array][12]&lt;[string][7]> | [string][7])** A User ID or an array of User IDs.

Returns **([Array][12]&lt;[Object][6]> | [Object][6])** List of user presence information.

### getAll

Retrieves the presence information for all available users.

Returns **[Array][12]&lt;[Object][6]>** List of user presence information.

### getSelf

This information is set using the [presence.update][94] API.

Returns **[Object][6]** Presence information for the current user.

### fetch

Fetches presence information for the given users. This will refresh the
   available information with any new information from the server.

Available presence information an be retrieved using the
   [presence.get][87] or [presence.getAll][88] APIs.

**Parameters**

-   `user` **([Array][12]&lt;[string][7]> | [string][7])** A User ID or an array of User IDs.

### subscribe

Subscribe to another User's presence updates.

When the User updates their presence information, the SDK will emit a

### unsubscribe

Unsubscribe from another User's presence updates.

**Parameters**

-   `users` **([Array][12]&lt;[string][7]> | [string][7])** A User ID or an array of User IDs.

## sdpHandlers

A set of [SdpHandlerFunction][95]s for manipulating SDP information.
These handlers are used to customize low-level call behaviour for very specific
environments and/or scenarios. They can be provided during SDK instantiation
to be used for all calls.

**Examples**

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';
const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover(['VP8', 'VP9'])
const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [ <Your-SDP-Handler-Function>, ...]
  }
})
```

### createCodecRemover

In some scenarios it's necessary to remove certain codecs being offered by the SDK to the remote party.
While creating an SDP handler would allow a user to perform this type of manipulation, it is a non-trivial task that requires in-depth knowledge of WebRTC SDP.

To facilitate this common task, the SDK provides a codec removal handler creator that can be used for this purpose.

The SDP handlers are exposed on the entry point of the SDK. They need to be added to the list of SDP handlers via configuration on creation of an instance of the SDK.

**Parameters**

-   `codecs` **[Array][12]&lt;[string][7]>** A list of codec names to remove from the SDP.

**Examples**

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';
const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover(['VP8', 'VP9'])
const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [codecRemover]
  }
})
```

Returns **[call.SdpHandlerFunction][15]** The resulting SDP handler that will remove the codec.

## services

The 'services' namespace allows an application to manage how they wish the SDK to
   receive communications from the platform. An application can subscribe to
   services in order to receive updates about that service for the current
   user. A feature generally requires a subscription for its service to be
   fully functional.

The services an application can subscribe to are based on the features
   included in the SDK. The list of available services can be retrieved
   using the [services.getSubscriptions][96] API. These values can be used
   with the [services.subscribe][97] API.

The channel used for subscriptions is the method for receiving the service
   updates. The recommended channel is `websocket`, where the SDK is able to
   handle receiving the updates internally. Alternate channel methods, if a
   websocket cannot be used, will be available in the future.

### ServiceDescriptor

The ServiceDescriptor type defines the format for specifying how to subscribe for a certain service.
This is the service configuration object that needs to be passed (as part of an array of configuration objects) when calling
the [services.subscribe][97] function.
Only some plugins (`call`, `messaging` and `presence`) support such configuration object that needs to be passed
to the subscribe function.

Type: [Object][6]

**Properties**

-   `service` **[string][7]** The name of the available service user wants to subscribe to.
    The available service names are `chat`, `presence`, `call` and `smsinbound`.
-   `params` **[Object][6]?** An object containing any additional parameters required for subscribing to that service.
    This is an optional property as not all service subscriptions require it.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Subscribe to chat, presence & call services on a WebSocket channel.
client.services.subscribe([
   {service: 'chat'},
   {service: 'presence'},
   {service: 'call'},
], 'websocket')
```

### SmsInboundServiceParams

The SmsInboundServiceParams type defines the additional information when subscribing to SMS inbound service.
This is the configuration object that needs to be passed as the value for the [ServiceDescriptor.params][98] property.

Type: [Object][6]

**Properties**

-   `destinationAddress` **[string][7]** An E164 formatted DID number.
        The subscription created will provide notifications for inbound SMS messages destined for this address.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Subscribe to smsinbound service on a WebSocket channel.
client.services.subscribe([
   {service: 'smsinbound', params: {destinationAddress: '+18001234567'}}
], 'websocket')
```

### subscribe

Subscribes to platform notifications for an SDK service.

Subscriptions can only be made for services available to the SDK. See
   [services.getSubscriptions][96] for information about services.

Extra configurations can be provided for a subscription as part of its
   "service configurations" object (see the `services` parameter). This
   configuration object must contain a `service` property with the
   service name, but may also include other properties as extra
   subscription configurations.

The SDK currently only supports the `websocket` channel as a subscription
   type.

**Parameters**

-   `services` **[Array][12]&lt;([string][7] \| [services.ServiceDescriptor][99])>** A list of service configurations.
-   `type` **[string][7]** The method of how to receive service updates. (optional, default `'websocket'`)

**Examples**

```javascript
// Subscribe for chat and SMS services.
const services = [
   { service: 'chat' },
   // Specify extra configurations for certain services.
   { service: 'smsinbound', params: {destinationAddress: '<phoneNumber>' }}
]

client.services.subscribe(services)
```

### unsubscribe

Cancels existing subscriptions for platform notifications.

Existing subscriptions can be retrieved using the
   [services.getSubscriptions][96] API. The `subscribed` values are the
   services that can be unsubscribed from.

**Parameters**

-   `services` **[Array][12]&lt;[string][7]>** A list of subscribed service names.
-   `type` **[string][7]** The method of how the service updates
       are being received. (optional, default `'websocket'`)

**Examples**

```javascript
// Unsubscribe from chat and SMS services.
const services = [ 'chat', 'smsinbound' ]

client.services.unsubscribe(services)
```

### getSubscriptions

Retrieves information about currently subscribed services and available services.

The `available` values are the SDK's services that an application can
   subscribe to receive notifications about. A feature generally
   requires a subscription to its service in order to be fully functional.

The `subscribed` values are the SDK's services that the application has
   an active subscription for. Services are subscribed to using the
   [services.subscribe][97] API.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Get the lists of services.
const services = client.services.getSubscriptions()

// Figure out which available services don't have a subscription.
const notSubscribed = services.available.filter(service => {
   return !services.subscribed.includes(service)
})

// Subscribe for all not-yet-subscribed services.
client.services.subscribe(notSubscribed)
```

Returns **[Object][6]** Lists of subscribed and available services.

The SDK will emit a [users:change][101]
   event after the operation completes. The User's information will then
   be available.

Information about an available User can be retrieved using the
   [user.get][102] API.

**Parameters**

-   `userId` **[string][7]** The User ID of the user.

### fetchSelfInfo

Fetches information about the current User from directory.
This API is simply a shortcut for the [user.fetch(getUserInfo().identity)][103] API.

The SDK will emit a [users:change][101]
   event after the operation completes. The User's information will then
   be available.

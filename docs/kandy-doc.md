## Calls

The Calls feature is used to make audio and video calls to and from
SIP users and PSTN phones.

Call functions are all part of the 'call' namespace.

### make

Starts an outgoing call to a [UserID][6] or a [PhoneNumber][7].

The call will be tracked by a unique ID that is returned by the API. The
   application will use this ID to identify and control the call after it
   has been initiated.

The [call.getById][8] API can be used to retrieve the
   current information about the call.

The SDK will emit a [call:start][9] event
   locally when the operation completes. When the remote participant
   receives the call, a [call:receive][10]
   event will be emitted remotely for them.

The SDK requires access to the machine's media devices (e.g. microphone)
   in order to make a call. If it does not already have permissions to
   use the devices, the user may be prompted by the browser to give
   permissions.

**Parameters**

-   `destination` **([UserID][11] \| [PhoneNumber][12])** The desired destination.
-   `media` **[Object][5]** The media options the call should be initialized with.
    -   `media.audio` **[boolean][13]** Whether the call should have audio on start. Currently, audio-less calls are not supported. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.audioOptions` **[Object][5]?** Options for configuring the call's audio.
        -   `media.audioOptions.deviceId` **[MediaConstraint][14]?** ID of the microphone to receive audio from.
    -   `media.video` **[boolean][13]** Whether the call should have video on start. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.videoOptions` **[Object][5]?** Options for configuring the call's video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.deviceId` **[MediaConstraint][14]?** ID of the camera to receive video from.
        -   `media.videoOptions.height` **[MediaConstraint][14]?** The height of the video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.width` **[MediaConstraint][14]?** The width of the video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.frameRate` **[MediaConstraint][14]?** The frame rate of the video.
-   `options` **[Object][5]?** 
    -   `options.bandwidth` **[BandwidthControls][15]?** Options for configuring media's bandwidth.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Listen for the event emitted after making a call.
client.on('call:start', function (params) {
  const { callId, error } = params
  if (error) {
    // Call failed to initialize.
  } else {
    // Call was initialized, and the recipient user will be notified.
  }
})
// Make an audio-only call.
const newCallId = client.call.make(destination, { audio: true })
```

Returns **[string][2]** The generated ID of the newly created call.

### reject

Rejects an incoming call.

The specified call to reject must be in a ringing state with an incoming
   direction. The call will be ended as a result of the operation.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][16]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified, through their own
   [call:stateChange][16] event, that the
   call was rejected.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][2]** The ID of the call to reject.

### answer

Answers an incoming call.

The specified call to answer must be in a ringing state with an incoming
   direction. The call will become connected as a result of the operation.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][16]
   event locally when the operation completes. This indicates that the
   call has connected with the remote participant. The
   [call.getById][8] API can be used to retrieve the
   latest call state after the change. Further events will be emitted to
   indicate that the call has received media from the remote participant.
   See the [call:newTrack][17] event for
   more information about this.

The SDK requires access to the system's media devices (eg. microphone)
   in order to answer a call. If it does not already have permissions to
   use the devices, the user may be prompted by the browser to give
   permissions.

### hold

Puts a call on hold.

The specified call to hold must not already be locally held. Any/all
   media received from the remote participant will stop being received,
   and any/all media being sent to the remote participant will stop
   being sent.

Some call operations cannot be performed while the call is on hold. The
   call can be taken off hold with the [call.unhold][18] API.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][16]

The specified call to unhold must be locally held. If the call is not
   also remotely held, call media will be reconnected as it was before
   the call was held.

The SDK will emit a [call:stateChange][16]
   event locally when the operation completes. The remote participant
   will be notified of the operation through a
   [call:stateChange][16] event as well.

The provided tone can either be a single DTMF tone (eg. '1') or a
   sequence of DTMF tones (eg. '123') which will be played one after the
   other.

The specified call must be either in Connected or Ringing state,
   otherwise invoking this API will have no effect.

The tones will be sent as out-of-band tones if supported by the call,
   otherwise they will be added in-band to the call's audio.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][2]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `tone` **[string][2]** DTMF tone(s) to send. Valid chracters are ['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','#','*' and ','].

   as an announced or warm transfer). This allows the current user to
   transfer the remote participant of a call to another user, after
   having spoken to both users.

Both calls used for the transfer must be locally held. Both remote
   participants will see their call be unheld, and will be connected to
   one another after the operation. Both calls for the current user will
   be ended.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][2]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `otherCallId` **[string][2]** ID of the other call being acted on.

### join

Performs a "join" on two ongoing calls.
This allows the current user to establish a call with audio with two
   remote users.

Both specified calls must be locally held. The "joined" call will be
   audio-only, even if either previous call had video. Video cannot be
   added to the "joined" call. Both remote participants will see their
   call taken off hold, and will receive additional audio from other
   participants after the operation. Both calls for the current user will
   be ended after the operation.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][2]** ID of the call being acted on.
-   `otherCallId` **[string][2]** ID of the other call being acted on.

### replaceTrack

Replace a call's track with a new track of the same media type.

The operation will remove the old track from the call and add a
   new track to the call. This effectively allows for changing the
   track constraints (eg. device used) for an ongoing call.

The SDK will emit a
   [call:trackReplaced][23] event
   locally when the operation completes. The newly added track will need
   to be handled by the local application. The track will be replaced
   seamlessly for the remote application, which will not receive an event.

**Parameters**

-   `callId` **[string][2]** The ID of the call to replace the track of.
-   `trackId` **[string][2]** The ID of the track to replace.
-   `media` **[Object][5]** The media options. (optional, default `{}`)
    -   `media.audio` **[boolean][13]** Whether to create an audio track. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.audioOptions` **[Object][5]?** Options for configuring the audio track.
        -   `media.audioOptions.deviceId` **[MediaConstraint][14]?** ID of the microphone to receive audio from.
    -   `media.video` **[boolean][13]** Whether to create a video track. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `media.videoOptions` **[Object][5]?** Options for configuring the video track.
        -   `media.videoOptions.deviceId` **[MediaConstraint][14]?** ID of the camera to receive video from.
        -   `media.videoOptions.height` **[MediaConstraint][14]?** The height of the video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.width` **[MediaConstraint][14]?** The width of the video.
        -   `media.videoOptions.frameRate` **[MediaConstraint][14]?** The frame rate of the video.

**Examples**

```javascript
const callId = ...
// Get the video track used by the call.
const videoTrack = ...

// Replace the specified video track of the call with a new
//    video track.
client.call.replaceTrack(callId, videoTrack.id, {
  // The track should be replaced with a video track using
  //    a specific device. This effectively changes the input
  //    device for an ongoing call.
  video: true,
  videoOptions: {
    deviceId: cameraId
  }
})
```

### states

Possible states that a Call can be in.

A Call's state describes the current status of the Call. An application
   should use the state to understand how the Call, and any media
   associated with the Call, should be handled. Which state the Call is
   in defines how it can be interacted with, as certain operations can
   only be performed while in specific states, and tells an application
   whether the Call currently has media flowing between users.

The Call's state is a property of the [CallObject][24], which can be
   retrieved using the [call.getById][8] or
   [call.getAll][25] APIs.

The SDK emits a [call:stateChange][16]
   event when a Call's state changes from one state to another.

**Properties**

-   `INITIATING` **[string][2]** The (outgoing) call is being started.
-   `INITIATED` **[string][2]** The (outgoing) call has been sent over the network, but has not been received.
-   `RINGING` **[string][2]** The call has been received by both parties, and is waiting to be answered.
-   `CANCELLED` **[string][2]** The call was disconnected before it could be answered.
-   `CONNECTED` **[string][2]** Both parties are connected and media is flowing.
-   `ON_HOLD` **[string][2]** Both parties are connected but no media is flowing.
-   `ENDED` **[string][2]** The call has ended.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Use the call states to know how to handle a change in the call.
client.on('call:stateChange', function (params) {
   const call = client.call.getById(params.callId)
   // Check if the call now has media flowing.
   if (call.state === client.call.states.CONNECTED) {
     // Render call media ...
   }
})
```

## Media

The Media feature provides an interface for interacting with Media that the
   SDK has access to. Media is used conjunction with the [Calls][26]
   feature to manipulate and render the Tracks sent and received from a Call.

Media and Track objects are not created directly, but are created as part of
   Call operations. Media and Tracks will either be marked as "local" or
   "remote" depending on whether their source is the local user's machine
   or a remote user's machine.

The Media feature also keeps track of media devices that the user's machine
   can access. Any media device (eg. USB headset) connected to the machine
   can be used as a source for media. Available devices can be found using
   the [media.getDevices][27] API.

Media functions are all part of the 'media' namespace.

### getDevices

Retrieves the available media devices for use.

The [devices:change][28] event will be
   emitted when the available media devices have changed.

Returns **[Object][5]** The lists of camera, microphone, and speaker devices.

### getById

Retrieves an available Media object with a specific Media ID.

**Parameters**

-   `mediaId` **[string][2]** The ID of the Media to retrieve.

### getTrackById

Retrieve an available Track object with a specific Track ID.

**Parameters**

-   `trackId` **[string][2]** The ID of the Track to retrieve.

Returns **[TrackObject][30]** A Track object.

### renderTracks

Render Media Tracks in a container.

The container is specified by providing a CSS selector string that
   corresponds to the HTMLElement to act as the container.

**Parameters**

-   `trackIds` **[Array][19]&lt;[string][2]>** List of Track IDs to be rendered.
-   `cssSelector` **[string][2]** A CSS selector string that uniquely
       identifies an element. Ensure that special characters are properly
       escaped.
-   `options` **[Object][5]?** Additional options for rendering the tracks.
    -   `options.speakerId` **[string][2]?** The speaker's Device ID to use for audio tracks.

**Examples**

```javascript
// When an outgoing call is accepted, render the Media used for the call.
client.on('call:accepted', function (params) {
    // Get the information about the call.
    const call = client.call.getById(params.callId)

    // Render the call's local and remote media in their respective containers.
    client.media.render(call.localMedia[0], localContainer)
    client.media.render(call.remoteMedia[0], remoteContainer)
})

### muteTracks

Mutes the specified Tracks at their media source.

Prevents media from being received for the Tracks. Audio Tracks will
   become silent and video Tracks will be a black frame.

If a local Track being sent in a Call is muted, the Track will be
   noticeably muted for the remote user. If a remote Track received in a
   call is muted, the result will only be noticeable locally.

The SDK will emit a [media:muted][31] event
   when a Track has been muted.

**Parameters**

-   `trackIds` **[Array][19]&lt;[string][2]>** List of Track IDs.

### unmuteTracks

Unmutes the specified Tracks.

Media will resume as normal for the Tracks.

The SDK will emit a [media:unmuted][32] event
   when a Track has been unmuted.

A Message object represents an individual message that was delivered to a recipient and it is
obtained through the [Conversation.getMessages][46] or [Conversation.getMessage][48] API on an existing conversation.

Messages have Parts which represent pieces of a message, such as a text part, a json object part or a file part.

Once the sender sends a message, this message is saved in sender's state as an object.

## sdpHandlers

A set of [SdpHandlerFunction][80]s for manipulating SDP information.
These handlers are used to customize low-level call behaviour for very specific
environments and/or scenarios. They can be provided during SDK instantiation
to be used for all calls.

**Examples**

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';
const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover(['VP8', 'VP9'])
const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [ <Your-SDP-Handler-Function>, ...]
  }
})
```

### createCodecRemover

In some scenarios it's necessary to remove certain codecs being offered by the SDK to the remote party.
While creating an SDP handler would allow a user to perform this type of manipulation, it is a non-trivial task that requires in-depth knowledge of WebRTC SDP.

To facilitate this common task, the SDK provides a codec removal handler creator that can be used for this purpose.

The SDP handlers are exposed on the entry point of the SDK. They need to be added to the list of SDP handlers via configuration on creation of an instance of the SDK.

**Parameters**

-   `codecs` **[Array][19]&lt;[string][2]>** A list of codec names to remove from the SDP.

**Examples**

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';
const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover(['VP8', 'VP9'])
const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [codecRemover]
  }
})
```

Returns **[SdpHandlerFunction][79]** The resulting SDP handler that will remove the codec.

## Logger

The internal logger is used to provide information about the SDK's behaviour.
The logger can provide two types of logs: basic logs and action logs. Basic
logs are simple lines of information about what the SDK is doing during operations.
Action logs are complete information about a specific action that occurred
within the SDK, providing debug information describing it.
The amount of information logged can be configured as part of the SDK configuration.
See [config.logs][81] .

### levels

Possible levels for the SDK logger.

**Properties**

-   `SILENT` **[string][2]** Log nothing.
-   `ERROR` **[string][2]** Log only unhandled errors.
-   `WARN` **[string][2]** Log issues that may cause problems or unexpected behaviour.

## Subscription

The Services feature allows an application to manage how they wish the SDK to
   receive communications from the platform. An application can subscribe to
   services in order to receive updates about that service for the current
   user. A feature generally requires a subscription for its service to be
   fully functional.

The services an application can subscribe to are based on the features
   included in the SDK. The list of available services can be retrieved
   using the [services.getSubscriptions][87]
   API. These values can be used with the
   [services.subscribe][88] API.

The channel used for subscriptions is the method for receiving the service
   updates. The recommended channel is `websocket`, where the SDK is able to
   handle receiving the updates internally. Alternate channel methods, if a
   websocket cannot be used, will be available in the future.

Service functions are all part of the 'services' namespace.

### subscribe

Subscribes to platform notifications for an SDK service.

Subscriptions can only be made for services available to the SDK. See
   [services.getSubscriptions][87] for
   information about services.

The SDK currently only supports the `websocket` channel as a subscription
   type.

**Parameters**

-   `services` **[Array][19]&lt;[string][2]>** A list of available services.
-   `type` **[string][2]** The method of how to receive service updates. (optional, default `'websocket'`)

### unsubscribe

Cancels existing subscriptions for platform notifications.

Existing subscriptions can be retrieved using the
   [services.getSubscriptions][89] API.
   The `subscribed` values are the services that can be unsubscribed from.

**Parameters**

-   `services` **[Array][19]&lt;[string][2]>** A list of subscribed services.
-   `type` **[string][2]** The method of how the service updates
       are being received. (optional, default `'websocket'`)

### getSubscriptions

Retrieves information about currently subscribed services and available services.

The `available` values are the SDK's services that an application can
   subscribe to receive notifications about. A feature generally
   requires a subscription to its service in order to be fully functional.

The `subscribed` values are the SDK's services that the application has
   an active subscription for. Services are subscribed to using the
   [services.subscribe][90] API.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Get the lists of services.
const services = client.services.getSubscriptions()

// Figure out which available services don't have a subscription.
const notSubscribed = services.available.filter(service => {
   return !services.subscribed.includes(service)
})

// Subscribe for all not-yet-subscribed services.
client.services.subscribe(notSubscribed)
```

Returns **[Object][5]** Lists of subscribed and available services.

## BasicError

**Properties**

-   `code` **[string][2]** The code of the error. If no code is known, this will be 'NO_CODE'.
-   `message` **[string][2]** A human-readable message to describe the error. If no message is known, this will be 'An error occured'.

## User

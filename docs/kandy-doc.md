## create

The SDK creation factory. Create an instance of the SDK by calling this factory with the desired configurations.
The SDK instance will be refered as 'api' throughout the rest of the documentation content.

**Parameters**

-   `config` **[config][1]** The configuration object.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Instantiate the SDK.
import { create } from 'kandy'
const client = create({
    authentication: { ... },
    logs: { ... },
    ...
});
// Use the SDK's API.
client.on( ... );
```

Returns **[api][2]** The SDK instance.

## config

The configuration object. This object defines what different configuration
values you can use when instantiating the SDK using the [create][3] function.

## api

The 'api' is the type returned by the create function.
It contains various top-level functions that pertain to SDK global instance
as well as several nested namespaces that pertain to various features (e.g. call, contacts, presence, etc).

## sdpHandlers

A set of [SdpHandlerFunction][4]s for manipulating SDP information.
These handlers are used to customize low-level call behaviour for very specific
environments and/or scenarios. They can be provided during SDK instantiation
to be used for all calls.

**Examples**

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';
const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover(['VP8', 'VP9'])
const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [ <Your-SDP-Handler-Function>, ...]
  }
})
```

### createCodecRemover

In some scenarios it's necessary to remove certain codecs being offered by the SDK to the remote party.
While creating an SDP handler would allow a user to perform this type of manipulation, it is a non-trivial task that requires in-depth knowledge of WebRTC SDP.

To facilitate this common task, the SDK provides a codec removal handler creator that can be used for this purpose.

The SDP handlers are exposed on the entry point of the SDK. They need to be added to the list of SDP handlers via configuration on creation of an instance of the SDK.

**Parameters**

-   `codecs` **[Array][5]&lt;[string][6]>** A list of codec names to remove from the SDP.

**Examples**

```javascript
import { create, sdpHandlers } from 'kandy';
const codecRemover = sdpHandlers.createCodecRemover(['VP8', 'VP9'])
const client = create({
  call: {
    sdpHandlers: [codecRemover]
  }
})
```

Returns **call.SdpHandlerFunction** The resulting SDP handler that will remove the codec.
